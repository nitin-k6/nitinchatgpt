Main Problem I faced while building the website and how I have tackled

The main problem I have faced was fetching chatgpt api key as it is paid feature so I was not able to fetch
result using that. I have read the documentation and got to knnow that this feature was no longer free. So
I had to use Google Gemini key to fetch the result and had to change the code accordingly. It is working
good. And this flexibility also allow that whenever I want to change the api key I can do it.
